Considering that some of you weren't at the Wednesday (October 1st)
Software Devel Club meeting and all of you left email as a point of
contact, I thought I'd give a more formal attempt at reaching out (and
maybe a chance to show-off the mailing list that I set up this week ;)

So, because you all signed an interest form to be in a group project,
you were chosen by the Club on this wonderful coding expedition with a
group of other people who also submitted that form.  That group happened
to be the group I am in and I happen to be the leader.

In case you weren't privy to this, here is the group assignment spreadsheet
(it is read-only -- trust me, we tried editing it :c):

    https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/<REDACTED>

... Hence this email.  Oh and Hello by the way!  I know I didn't start
this email with that (and probably should); I just don't want to waste
your time and energy processing irrelevant information.  I hope you
don't take that for rudeness...

So I have a task for all of you -- can everyone tell me:

  * Your preferred means of communication (email, Discord, texting, etc.)

  * How much time you want to put into the Club

  * If you consent to future emails (not including this one) being
    archived on <https://list.rapidcow.org/inbox/wisc-sdc-fa25-team/>

  * If you are in support of a login-protected archive

  * The kind of programming you feel comfortable with doing (you don't
    have to be good; you just have to like it), the kind of programming
    you look forward to doing for this email (if different)

  * Also, I plan to use GitHub Pages for shared place for brainstorm
    ideas.  It hasn't been set up yet (because I need to clean up my
    existing GitHub Pages site and figure out how to hook up the CIs),
    but first I need to know:  How much Git/shell do people know?
    How much GitHub do people know?  Are we okay with this or do people
    want something that is perhaps easier like Google Docs or Notion?

For example, for me, I might answer:

  * The mailing list, with UTF-8 plain text wrapped at 72-80 chars
    (I host the list archive!)  Though I am fine with Discord,
    Instagram, texting (iMessage; I have an iPhone); or even
    Matrix and IRC...

  * 4 hours per week (minimum, not strictly, but I'd have a hard time
    keeping up homework and maintaining my own systems if I pour in
    too much time here :,)

  * N/A to me (if you say no, you can post to the list and people on
    the list will have your message forwarded to them, but I will not
    archive your message.  I will assume no unless you say otherwise.)

  * N/A (Please don't feel pressured to say yes!  Writing a login
    middleware will take me some time, and it will force EVERYONE to
    have to remember a password for login (though I could consider doing
    GitHub OAuth, that would still be more headache to me...); say yes
    only if you REALLY value anonymity on the Web!)

  * I do web server maintenance, infrastructure, HTTP endpoints, the
    so-called "backend" programming; one-off scripts, Unix commands.
    I look forward to doing CGI/PSGI/Mojo, WSGI/ASGI/Django, SSG such as
    Hugo; Golang/Rust API; but stuff like React.js, Svelte are cool too!

Here is an example of all the Git/VCS-related skills I know (and
consider to be quite essential) and would like to know if YOU know.
Your response doesn't have to be anywhere near this long.  But be
HONEST -- this isn't one of those end-of-semester course feedback,
and I *will* take your response seriously!

    I know the difference between the staging area (index) and commits
    (trees), and I know how to read and write arbitrary files to each
    using porcelain commands (git-show, git-add, git-rm; git-commit)
    as well as plumbing commands (git-cat-file, git-update-index,
    git-read-tree; git-commit-tree).  (If you use a different Git client
    like GitButler, that's okay too; but just be specific.)  I know the
    difference between a checked-out work tree and a repository, and I
    know how to visualize a diff between the two (git-status and git-diff).

    I understand that cryptographic functions are deterministic, and the
    ones employed by Git (SHA-1 or SHA-256) are no exception; I understand
    the immutability of commit SHAs and I know how to correctly produce
    a permanent URL to a certain commit or blob.  I am aware of the
    fundamental difference between branches and tags, in that tags are
    immutable and long-lived like the SHAs, whereas branches are mutable
    and are often transient (though I myself have yet to establish a working
    versioning scheme or to grow accustomed to software release cycles :x).

    I know how to list the branches and tags I have, local (git-branch,
    git-tag, git-show-ref, git-for-each-ref) or remote (git-ls-remote).
    I know how to checkout a commit using git-switch, or with git-checkout
    while carrying great responsibility and a SHARP awareness that it is
    a long-standing, multi-purposed, but overloaded and dangerous command.

    I understand tag updates are generally forbidden and branch updates
    are generally permitted under the condition that the set of reachable
    commits is monotonic (in other words, let A be the set of reachable
    commits from the new branch tip, and B be that of the old branch tip.
    Then a branch update is permissible if and only if B is a subset of A.)

    I understand what it means for commit histories to diverge, and I know
    how to interpret the numbers of left/right commits from git-status, or
    git rev-list --left-right --count A...B (or even a Git prompt). I know
    a way to review the symmetric difference between the sets of reachable
    commits using git log --left-right --graph A...B, and I know how to
    (or at least understand in theory) how to join two diverging commits
    using a merge or a rebase.  (Note that unlike CS400, I do not require
    you to resolve a merge conflict; but I may ask questions about your
    rationale for the changes you make.)

    And finally, I know how to push and fetch branches and/or tags from
    a remote repository, including but not limited to another repository
    on my machine (bare or non-bare), a remote repository over the Secure
    Shell protocol (SSH on port 22), and the HTTP protocol using the Basic
    authentication scheme (RFC 7617).  (I can also correctly identify the
    username and password of a URI (RFC 3986), so that when I share my Git
    remote URI publicly, I know not to compromise my account by redacting
    the password part of the URI.  (This sounds like a stupid thing to say
    out loud, but people who have taken CS400 blissfully unaware of the URI
    syntax exist.))  I know how to configure an upstream branch by using
    git push -u or git branch -u, and I know that pull is in fact a two-step
    process (fetch followed by merge/rebase, with the most possible point
    of failure being the latter (when histories diverge) rather than the
    former (when network fails).)  I also understand that when pushing, I am
    uploading a complete history of EVERY file to ever exist within the
    reachable commits, not just the earliest one.  If I accidentally pushed
    a token, I must assume that it has been compromised, and revoke then
    replace it as soon as I can.  I am also aware that a commit contains
    metadata such as my name, my email, and my time zone, which is visible
    to anyone with access to the repository.

Here is an example of the GitHub/collaboration skills I might anticipate:

    I know how to grant my client push/fetch access, either via OAuth
    (for Git clients like GitButler), or via SSH public key auth by
    registering my public key in my settings under "Access > SSH and GPG
    keys", or via HTTP Basic Auth by generating a Personal Access Token
    under "Developer Settings".  I am aware that, if I sign a commit/tag
    using GnuPG, I should paste my PGP public key -- exported in the
    format of ASCII armor -- to the "SSH and GPG keys", and that all
    emails listed under my identities should be verified in the "Access
    > Emails" panel, so that GitHub would mark my signatures as trusted.
    I know how to create pull requests (draft or not) from another branch
    in the same GitHub repository or a branch from a GitHub fork.  I
    know how to suggest a patch to another person using a "suggestion"
    code block (as shown here: <https://stackoverflow.com/a/69044609>) and
    I know how to accept and apply a suggestion patch to my branch from
    which I created pull request.  (If you have contributed to a project
    on GitHub, tell me!  Even if it's just something like fixing CPython's
    documentation or correcting a typo... you don't have to say what you
    did specifically, but the fact that you did anything at all helps.)

You can email the response to me privately, or reply-to-all on this list,
or use Discord channel that folks at the Software Development Club
created just for us in:

    https://discord.com/channels/<SERVER_ID_REDACTED>/<CHANNEL_ID_REDACTED>

(If you are in the server but do not have access to the channel, ping the
Admins (not me)!  I have no control over this. :)

                             * * * * * * * * *

(Other, less important info below.  (If you want to be on the list, read on!))

The Discord server is also home to many other resources, such as the meeting
slides some of you have missed.  Even if you are on the Club's mailing list,
I highly suggest that you join the Discord server with your account even if
just to know when the next meeting will be (which is next Wednesday, October =
8,
Morgridge Hall Room 2516 by the way.)

If you aren't already in the server unfortunately I can't find my invite link.
They don't seem to provide a permanent invite link that's just public out
there for whatever reason, and I want to respect that.  That said, it is
your choice whether we end up using Discord, email, or whatever.  (Matrix,
even!)  I will be using my crude setup of a mailing list for announcements
like this and important changes to our Git codebase, which (mind you) I
maintain a copy of on the Web too.  For example, this particular message
will be archived at the URL:

    <https://list.rapidcow.org/inbox/wisc-sdc-fa25-team/1759626667.1796322.df=
64AEa1052d0@e.rapidcow.org/>

(Don't worry -- the important links and your emails will be censored.  The
inbox database isn't fully synchronized with the IMAP inbox, and much of
the work is manual by me anyways, so I might as well blur out things that
are important. :)  Nonetheless, if you don't want your message to end up
on the Web at all, please remove

    <wisc-sdc-fa25-team@list.rapidcow.org>

from your recipient list (both To and Cc) and I will know not to consider
it for archival.  If you Bcc the list instead, anyone on the list would
still have that email forwarded to them, except I won't archive it (as if
you have opted out this one time).

No one is on the list at the moment.  I know you all are busy people with
busy inboxes, so to put yourself on the list, you should voluntarily
opt-in to email forwarding by send an email to

    <wisc-sdc-fa25-team+subscribe@list.rapidcow.org>

from your preferred email address for subscribing to the list; and

    <wisc-sdc-fa25-team+unsubscribe@list.rapidcow.org>

to unsubscribe.  I will not archive emails sent to any of these addresses
with the plus sign.  I will also remind you the instructions for subscription
/ unsubscription every time you email to these addresses.  (I am currently
unable to add a footer / List-Unsubscribe header in the forwarded emails as
they are pretty much forwarded verbatim (minus SRS rewrite), so please keep
a receipt of your subscription in case you need to unsubscribe. :c)

Regardless of your subscription status, you will always have access to
the list online at list.rapidcow.org, or in its raw form at:

    <https://github.com/rapidcow/list-wisc-sdc-fa25-team>

All of these will be updated shortly after I send this email.  Thanks. :)
